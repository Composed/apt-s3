apt-s3
------
additional "s3" protocol for apt so you can host your giant apt repository in s3 on the cheap!

Author: Kyle Shank

We use this for pressflip.com to deploy and distribute all of our software.  apt is a great packaging system and s3 is a great place to backup/store static files.  apt-s3 is especially useful and fast if you are hosting your servers within EC2.

THIS NEEDS MORE DOCUMENTATION OBVIOUSLY

TODO
----
* Makefile
* Package up binaries
* Include uploader script to get repository into s3 bucket
* Explain this a little more

This has to be compiled with the source version of apt.

You can get the source here:

    bzr branch http://bzr.debian.org/apt/debian-sid apt-debian-sid

Once compiled, the resulting s3 binary must be placed in /usr/lib/apt/methods/ along with the other protocol binaries.

Finally, this is how you add it to the /etc/apt/sources.list file if you want your credentials in the url:

deb s3://AWS_ACCESS_ID:[AWS_SECRET_KEY_IN_BRACKETS]@s3.amazonaws.com/BUCKETNAME prod main

otherwise leave off the credentials and it will draw them from the environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_KEY_ID.

Simply upload all of your .deb packages and Packages.gz file into the s3 bucket you chose with the file key mapping that matches the file system layout.
